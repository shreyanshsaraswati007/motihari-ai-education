Motihari-AI-Education is an AI-driven community analysis project focused on Motihari (East Champaran), Bihar, designed to understand why educational and opportunity gaps exist and how they can be reduced using data-based insights. The project combines publicly available Indian datasets on population, literacy, gender ratio, schools, teacher availability, and internet access, and applies machine-learning models to uncover patterns that are not visible through traditional analysis. By using clustering algorithms, the project compares Motihari with other Bihar districts to identify whether it falls into a high-opportunity or low-opportunity group. A regression model is then used to determine which factors most strongly influence literacy levels. The results show that Motihari belongs to a lower-opportunity cluster characterized by lower literacy and weaker digital access, and that internet penetration has a strong positive relationship with literacy rates. This highlights that improving digital access, especially in rural and under-resourced communities, can directly support educational growth. The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used not just for technology, but for social impact—helping communities like Motihari identify real bottlenecks and design smarter interventions for education, gender equality, and long-term development.
